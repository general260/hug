## About me

Welcome to my human user guide, inspired by Chris Young. I'm a web developer and product manager who is in love with road trips. With a degree in computer science, I have actively understood the concept of basic programming for over 10 years and I'm constantly learning. I listen to music all the time and enjoy reading when I have to. I'm an introvert and a jovial outgoing mate, at the same time. I believe in travelling and writing, travelling because it exposes you in ways that are only possible through experience and not tales or pictures, and writing because of how much you can express your thoughts in words, its limitless. 

## Values 

1. Time is money
2. Time is priceless
3. Life is more important
4. If it's worth doing, it's worth doing very well
5. 'Missionaries not Mercenaries' project execution style 

## Energy

I'm as fluid as a good Product Requirement Document, and I attribute this character with having worked in different continents. I have come to realize that entering a new work place or work environment is like visiting a new country, it's a collection of people from different places, background, work ethic, mindset and more, you don't know what to expect in terms of work relationships but you have to be cordial, first and foremost. Then, you have to learn to make it work, I have learnt to always make it work. My work energy is to get things done as quickly as possible, to either learn fast or progress fast, there's no failure. I approach problem solving at work with a notion of trying to understand the problem prior to jumping into research or solution, I like to make sure that the problem is an actual problem and not one that is just perceived by me and the team. It's me/product team/development team/marketing team/stakeholder vs the problem, not vs each other. This is my work energy.

## Feedback

I prefer honesty when receiving feedbacks as that's the only way I can improve. But here's my problem with direct feedbacks, I have come to realize that negative feebacks are usually thrown around more often than the kudos which defeats the purpose of requesting direct feedbacks. The same manner you would condemn me for an oversight on a task, should be how you'll cheer me on when I get it done in little or no time. Like a 2-way street.

## PetPeeves

1. Unmotivated people
2. Rude people

## Learning 

I enjoy learning from my colleagues and never see them as a competition, we're working towards a common company goal so if you need to correct me, you're literally teaching me and I won't make the mistake again. So, thank you!

## Tech

I have written my fair share of code and now I'm the product guy but here's a few of the tech I've stumbled on and like: JavaScript, React, Node, HTML5, Bootstrap, SCSS, Django, Python. 

## Product

To me, product management is basically shaping, guiding and managing the entire product, from ideation/discovery to post-launch. While I understand that frameworks are essential, I believe the role of a product manager is way too dynamic to have a strict set of rules, depending on the product team, you might need to ship fast and learn fast, and sometimes your product discovery will take up majority of the time, this is why I remain fluid and ready to adapt, like a chameleon.
