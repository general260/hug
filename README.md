## HUG: Human User Guide

As explained by Chris Young, a HUG is literally the idea of a User Guide applied to a person, if an individual had a manual with a unique table of contents or FAQ. The HUG is intended to go deeper into professional aspects of an individual so that others don't need to assume how they like to get work done and in what type of environment they thrive in.
